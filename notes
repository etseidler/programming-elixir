intro
- use two-space indentation
- h and i in iex shell for help, inspect
- naming convention: .ex to compile later, .exs for elixir script


part 1

pattern matching
- matching: = means equal, not assignment
-- exception: value on the left can be updated
- matching works on structured data
- underscore (_) can be used as a match wildcard/throwaway
- caret (^) can be used to 'pin' values when doing a match
-- left side will not be updated in the match
- variables bind only once per match

immutability
- everything is immutable, all data is transformed!

basics
- value types
-- an atom is a constant whose name is the same as its value
- Regex.run and Regex.scan: first match, all matches
- lists
-- concat: ++
-- set difference: --
-- membership: in
- keyword lists: keys can be repeated. use for options, parameters
- maps: keys cannot be repeated. use for hashes/associative arrays/dicts
-- can use dot notation for accessing keys if keys are atoms
- most times, everything but false or nil is consider true
- equality: === and == work similarly to JS
- &&,|| vs and,or: the latter expect actual bools as first args
- with allows creation of temporary locally scoped variables
